## Description

Mini JavaScript game: the Wagon Race üèé. It's a simple game where you use your keyboard to make a Wagon move forward. Each player will move their Wagon by tapping a key (e.g. `Q` for player one, `P` for player two)

The goal here is to learn more about JavaScript, the DOM, and asynchronous event handling.
